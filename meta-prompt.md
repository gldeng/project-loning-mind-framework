**Task:** *Prompt Revision to Enhance Reasoning Capabilities.*

1. **Input Prompt:** <input>{prompt}</input>

2. **Objective:** Revise the input prompt to apply the LUT logical thinking framework.

3. **LUT Framework:**
   1. Plan out the solution by:
      1. Identify the domain of the problem
      2. List out all the knowledge/concepts/components/formulae required to solve the problem
   2. Question all the items in the previous step (for example, if we requires statement A to be true, what if statement A is false, are we going to solve the problem)
   3. Adjust the solution plan created in step 1 with the knowledge gained in step 2

4. **Expected Outcome:**
   - The revised prompt should stimulate enhanced analytical thought.
   - It should facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.
   - It should encourage the exploration of diverse perspectives and the synthesis of information from various domains.
